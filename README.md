# Social Network API

  ## Description
  This project is an exercise to create an API for a social network using a NoSQL database, so that  the website can handle a large amount of unstructured data. Users can share their thoughts, react to friends thoughts, and create a friend list. This application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. 

  Take a look at my walkthrough video on how the API routes function together [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VZNvqH-yAnqpl2hhGd4R13ApWaxDZ0Fr/view).
